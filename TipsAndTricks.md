  * On non Nexus one devices, try to use pure power of 2 images for the backgorunds: eg 1024x512 or 256x256 or anything else where both dimensions are power of 2

### Custom rotation axis ###
  * activate touch rotation and free rotation, be sure to have natural axis disabled, rotate the planet to the axis you want, then go back in settings and deactivate free rotation. If natural axis is not selected, the axis should stay fixed untill next reboot.
